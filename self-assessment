 HOMEWORK 3
 Zach Ziemann
 
 Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, 
 along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled. 
 
 This assignment works for both assignment 1 and 2, since they build directly off each other it makes sense to put them together here.
 They make a very functional calculator, with the added functions I was supposed to create and a display bar on top. 
 It has the other various requirements mentioned also in calculatorBrain.  
 The main changes are in the view controller and the calculator brain. 
 It also has a nice looking UI in the storyboard.
