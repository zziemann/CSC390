Assignment 1,2

1. How long did you spend on this assignment?
 - Getting used to this teacher and class, I spent a very long time on each of these assignments
(they each took days to do).  The second assignment took considerably less time but still long.

2. Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
A

3. Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
A

4. Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, 
along with an explanation of how you attempted 
to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.

 - This assignment works for both assignment 1 and 2, since they build directly off each other it makes sense to put them together here.
They make a very functional calculator, with the added functions I was supposed to create and a display bar on top. 
It has the other various requirements mentioned also in calculatorBrain.  
The main changes are in the view controller and the calculator brain classes.
It also has a nice looking UI in the storyboard.
